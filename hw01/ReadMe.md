This code creates a Etchy Sketch Board where as you move across a symbol will be placed where you have moved throughout the board. The code creates a 8x8 grid for the user and starts at postion (0,0) and you will progress across board using the command line. 


To execute the code you go into the terminal and call "chmod +x hw01.py". This will run the file hw01.py and then proceeds the code. 
The program makes a blank etchy sketch grid which will be used to make the sketch. A '+' will be wherever the location of the user is.
The user will put in a command on the command line such as 'u' for up, 'd' for down, 'r' for right, 'l' for left and 'c' for clear. These will either move the user location as instructed or clear the board entirely.
This will execute as long as you put in commands and you can close it by putting close into the command line.
